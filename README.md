# foody Flutter App

A Food Ordering/Delivery mobile app for Restaurants with a REST api written with Slim PHP.
 I tried as much as possible to stick to the <b>Bloc Pattern</b>, based on tutorials from the google developer channels, Brian Egan and the TensorFlow Programming youTube Channel. The app source code isn't well documented, so move through with caution..hahhaa

The Server Side is written with PHP(Slim) and hooked to a Mysql Server

The Folder foody_database contains the sql file for the database
Restaurant_api database contains the php REST Api

Please Feel Free to download and test the appp, incase of any issues, you know what to do(ISSUE an ISSUE)
